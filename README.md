# ChatUp-MERN_Project

# Overview

The Chat Application is a robust real-time messaging platform designed for both individual and group chats. Built with a Node.js and Express backend, a React.js frontend with Chakra UI for styling, MongoDB for data storage, and Socket.io for real-time communication. This application supports user and admin roles, profile management, group creation and management by admins, and offline real-time notifications. Security measures include JWT for authentication and authorization, cross-platform security, and protection against SQL injection.
